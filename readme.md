# one rm log

A free app from [penny farthing apps](http://pennyfarthingapps.com).

This app will log and track the user's 1 rep max for weight lifting. It's a side project, 
and so it is not going to be developed quickly and will not have a lot of resources put into it.

## Uses:

* [sqlite-net](https://github.com/praeclarum/sqlite-net)
* [PennyFarElements](http://penfarapps.com/Sx1v5n)

Enjoy.
